# Uncertainty-Aware Regression with Neural Networks

## Problem
Predict a continuous target value while estimating model uncertainty.
Uncertainty estimation is critical in scientific and industrial ML applications.

## Method
- Neural network regression
- Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation
- Implemented in TensorFlow/Keras

## Results
The model provides both mean predictions and uncertainty estimates
for unseen data.

## Industry relevance
Uncertainty-aware ML is widely used in sensor modeling, Earth Observation,
and scientific data analysis pipelines.
